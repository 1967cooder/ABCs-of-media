WordPress Practice Website

This project is a WordPress practice site created as a study exercise.  
The page is loosely modeled after https://abcsofmedia.com/ and runs in a local development environment at:

# My Flex WordPress Page

This is my practice WordPress page based on the ABC of Media model.

## 📌 Purpose of the Project

The main goals were to:

- Practice working with the WordPress theme structure
- Recreate a custom version of a single-page layout inspired by a reference site
- Learn how to navigate and modify the `wp-content/themes` folder
- Build page sections, add images, manage layout, and adjust typography
- Practice using the WordPress block editor and Full Site Editing tools

## 📁 File Structure (Theme: _fleks_)

All project-related files are located in:
wp-content/

Key files included in the theme:

- **style.css** — theme stylesheet and WordPress theme metadata

## 🔧 Technical Details
